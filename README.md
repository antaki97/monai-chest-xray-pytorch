**MONAI PyTorch Models**

This repository contains a collection of PyTorch models built using MONAI
, a deep learning framework for medical imaging. These models can be used for various medical imaging tasks, such as segmentation, classification, and more, depending on the specific architecture.

**Project Overview**

This project includes a set of pre-trained and custom-trained models implemented with MONAI, designed to address various challenges in medical imaging. The models are trained on popular medical datasets and demonstrate the ease of integrating MONAI with PyTorch to create powerful models for medical image analysis.

**Key Features**

MONAI-based architectures: Utilizes MONAI's powerful features for building and training models for medical imaging tasks.

Custom training pipelines: Includes code for training models on custom medical datasets.

Pre-trained models: If available, pre-trained models to jump-start your own projects.

Evaluation scripts: Provides tools for model evaluation on different datasets.

Visualization tools: Built-in methods to visualize model predictions and output.
